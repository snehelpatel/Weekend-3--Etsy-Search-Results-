Just as an FYI, we also sell on weekends out of our Airstream Studio at events and shows and a great deal of our pieces are shown both online and in the studio.\r\n\r\nVINYL RECORD COLLECTORS:  We have just acquired approximately 2000+ vinyl LP&#39;s.  Amazingly, they are filed by genre.  As it will take us a very long time to get these listed, we want to let you know that we will be happy to search the lot should you have a particular request.  Contact us with the album title, artist and any other relevant information and we will check to see if we have it!\r\n\r\nVINTAGE POSTCARD & PAPER EPHEMERA COLLECTORS:  We recently acquired a collection of several hundreds of vintage postcards, vintage stationary sets and vintage advertising.  We have many listed, however, if you are searching for something particular and don&#39;t see it, please contact us and we will let you know what we have.\r\n**************************\r\nREQUESTS:  If you are looking for a particular vintage item, drop us a line and let us know what it is you are searching for.  We travel between Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee on a regular basis searching for new items to add to our shop... who knows, we may find just what you are looking for!

Communication is key, and we want you to be happy with your total experience with CampyClassics.\r\n\r\nWe greatly appreciate your positive feedback and comments!  :-)","digital_sale_message":null,"last_updated_tsz":1450755173,"listing_active_count":123,"digital_listing_count":0,"login_name":"CampyClassics","accepts_custom_requests":true,"policy_welcome":"Welcome to CampyClassics.Etsy.com.  We appreciate your business and hope that your experience with us will be as fun for you as it has been for us.\r\n\r\nOnline selling has been an adventure for us, however, we have had to learn the typical ins and outs the hard way.  We have developed our policies to not only protect us, but our Buyers as well.\r\n\r\nVintage means classic, old, rare, mature.  All of our items are vintage.  We strive to describe our items with as much detail as possible, however, sometimes we don&#39;t for one reason or another.  We ask that you review the images we have posted, as they will give you a clear idea, along with our description, of what you are getting.  If at any time you have a question, we welcome you to contact us prior to purchasing an item.  We&#39;d prefer to be as clear and up-front about something rather than you get it and want to send it back.  \r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our store!  We appreciate our customers...   :- )","policy_payment":"PayPal is our preferred method of being paid, however, we do accept other forms such as Direct Checkout (via Etsy), Money Orders\/Cashier&#39;s Check, Personal Checks and Gift Cards.\r\n\r\nAny item that is purchased with a check of any form will be sent out once the check has cleared our bank (which may take up to a week).  We will communicate with you once we receive the check, once it is deposited, and once it clears and your item ships.  Under no circumstances will an item be shipped prior to the check clearing the bank... another hard lesson learned.\r\n\r\nCommunication is key!","policy_shipping":"Typically we ship everything USPS, unless otherwise stated in the description.  Custom orders may take time to complete (see item description for details), however, if you are purchasing something that has already been crafted\/printed\/made or a vintage item, we typically ship those items within 72 hours of receiving payment.  The only exception to our 72 hour shipping policy is on weekends when we are typically out in the Airstream Studio at a show.  We photograph our packages and get receipts with destination zip codes for each one.  If you&#39;d like a copy, we will scan and email to you upon request.\r\n\r\n** PLEASE NOTE ** We recycle... especially boxes!  Most likely your items may come in a &quot;big (online) box store that starts with an A and is the name of a river in South America&quot; box...  \r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED:  Shipping is for the continental United States via USPS with Delivery Confirmation.  Additional fees may be incurred for shipping to Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico.  \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:  We will ship internationally, however, we ask that you contact us prior to purchase (with your shipping address) so that we may give you an accurate cost for shipping and estimated delivery time.  Please contact us prior to purchase if you would like to know the exact price.  If an item shipment is above what we have listed, we will notify you and allow you to determine if you are still interested in the item.  We do not accept responsibility to items shipped outside the United States once they leave the hands of our postal service.  We will provide proof of shipment if an item is damaged or lost.  Thank you for your understanding.\r\n\r\nIf you need something faster, please contact us prior to purchase and we can make arrangements.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL ITEMS SHIPPING POLICY:  If noted in the description, we will refund any shipping cost above $1.00 of actual shipping cost fee.  (Example:  Our listed shipping cost is $27.95, but it only costs $14.95 to send.  We send you $13.00 back.)  Contact us with any questions.  Refund will be issued after Delivery Confirmation has been made. Please check the listing to see if the item you are interested in qualifies for this policy.  Not all items qualify (see item description).\r\n\r\nDELIVERY CONFIRMATION:  ALL items are sent with Delivery Confirmation, regardless of shipping carrier (USPS, UPS, DHL or FedEx).","policy_refunds":"We want everyone to be happy with their purchase.  We will accept returns for credit or replacement on damaged items, but proof must be provided of the packaging being damaged in transit.  You will need to assist us in making a claim, otherwise we will not accept returns.  We take particular care in packaging an item for shipment and photograph all of our items as they are being packaged and once they are packaged.  \r\n\r\nTRUE STORY:  We sold a vintage leather clutch to a woman who was excited to use it at her daughter&#39;s wedding.  We carefully packed up the purse and shipped it off with Delivery Confirmation.  Didn&#39;t hear a thing for a couple of weeks, then we received the perfectly fine purse back in the mail with a note that said, &quot;The dress was damaged during shipping and I couldn&#39;t wear it at my daughter&#39;s wedding.  Please refund my money, plus what I paid to ship it back to you.&quot; \r\n\r\nOur point is, please communicate with us and document with photos as much as possible so that neither of us loose out on the transaction.","policy_additional":"We love to barter and trade, so if you are interested in something, contact us and we can discuss!\r\n\r\nFEEDBACK:   We appreciate positive personal comments and will strive to make your shopping experience with us as pleasant and fun as possible.  We don&#39;t expect it, but if it does happen, please contact us prior to leaving negative feedback.  We would appreciate the opportunity to work with you and resolve any issues.\r\n\r\n","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1465448500,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/CampyClassics?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/5356619\/iusb_760x100.11647416_gckt.jpg","num_favorers":237,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/073\/0\/5356619\/isla_fullxfull.16092409_2shia1yh.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":258683050,"state":"active","user_id":15809437,"category_id":68887346,"title":"Work Hard and Be Kind 14 oz Mug \u2013 Designed by Sara Moore (White with Gold Lettering) SALE!","description":"Designed by Sara Moore: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SaraMooreShoppe\r\n\r\n14oz White ceramic mug with gold hand lettering.

The handle and decorative top and black plastic (possibly Bakelite, but I did not test it) and the body of the tea pot is brass. It has a very heavy dark patina and I cannot be certain that it can even be cleaned off, although I did not try. It is quite lovely the way it is, and I think the heavy patina adds to its mysterious charm. It makes me wonder what kind of a history this tea pot has had. The inside is tin and is pretty clean, so it can be used to hold your tea or coffee. However, it would also look awesome as a rustic display piece. It holds about two cups and all its parts function properly. This vintage tea pot is unique and interesting and would be an unusual addition to any rustic decor. \n\nDimensions:  8.25&quot;H x  7&quot;L  x  3.25&quot;W  (holds approx. 2 cups)\n\nVisit our home

We do need at least 3 weeks of notice for these orders. Please reach out to us with your request and we will promptly get in touch!\n\nCARE INSTRUCTIONS\nSince our products are natural and organic and are minimally processed without chemical preservatives, our products have a shelf life of aprox 9 months to one year. Keeping your products out of heat, sunlight and humidity will extend the shelf life as well. \nDuring the hot summer months, it is advised to refrigerate any balms, creams or salves for at least 20 minutes prior to use as our ingredients have a naturally low melting point. If you live in a hot climate, we have non-toxic reusable cold packs for purchase to add to your shipment. The cold packs will help to reduce potential melting, ensuring your package arrives intact.\nIn cold weather months, products may be a firmer consistency. Simply warm in your hand before application.\n\nSIZING DETAILS\nWe offer several size variances (in ounces) on most products. If there&#39;s a specific product size you are looking for- be it larger or smaller- please send us a conversation and we would be happy to create it for you!\n\nSHIPPING\nWe ship via the USPS. We offer both First Class and Priority. Both include tracking of your purchase. Tracking is typically available 24 hours after the package is in the mail stream. Priority shipping is *not* guaranteed by a specific delivery date, however, most priority mail packages are delivered within 2-3 business days. Extreme weather events can delay a package. If there are overages in the shipping calculations, we always refund any amount back to the buyer greater than $1USD.\n\nRETURNS AND EXCHANGES\nDue to the nature of our products, we can only accept returns sealed in their original shrink-wrapped tamper proof seal. If you&#39;re unhappy with your product for any reason and would like to exchange it, we would be happy to suggest an alternate product that we think you&#39;d love. Just reach out to us via etsy!\n\nITEMS DAMAGED IN SHIPPING\nWe rarely experience an item that arrives damaged in shipping, however it can happen! Please contact us if your item arrives in less than perfect or damaged condition. We will do our best to make the situation right!\n\nSKIN SENSITIVITIES +  ALLERGENS\nOur focus is on organic products that are well tolerated by most. If you&#39;re sensitive to any ingredient please let us know! We have a wide variety of raw ingredients to choose from that may work better for your specific concern. \nFor Allergy Prone Individuals:: With any new product it&#39;s always best to spot test 24-hours prior to application. To spot test: Apply a small amount of product covering 1\/2 to 1 inch of the inner forearm. After 24 hours if no reaction has occurred, proceed as normal!\nPlease do not use if you notice any redness, irritation or other histaminic reaction. We do our best to create gentle, natural products safe for sensitive skin but realize that each individual need is different.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1459266330,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":true,"vacation_autoreply":"Hello and thank you for stopping by!

After milk firing pottery changes its own color from light brown to almost black so ceramic  will be a unique you didn&#39;t find two are alike.\n\n\nSee other art pottery --&gt;&gt; https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SmilingAlligator","creation_tsz":1476378428,"ending_tsz":1487009228,"original_creation_tsz":1428784593,"last_modified_tsz":1476378428,"price":"13.09","currency_code":"USD","quantity":15,"tags":["cup with saucer","coffee cup","stoneware cup","handmade cup","cups and saucers","unique cup","cups","gift cup","pottery present","pottery cup","Ceramics and pottery","tea cup","birthday gift"],"category_path":["Housewares"],"category_path_ids":[69150425],"materials":["blue clay","red clay","milk","glaze"],"shop_section_id":17043758,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1473864089,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/229558763\/tea-cup-ceramic-cup-with-saucer-ceramics?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":32027,"num_favorers":13845,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"collective","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":"birthday","style":["Folk","Rustic"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1062,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Kitchen & Dining","Drink & Barware","Drinkware","Mugs"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":997102807,"hex_code":"BD9A87","red":189,"green":154,"blue":135,"hue":21,"saturation":28,"brightness":74,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1459543009,"listing_id":229558763,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/10847850\/il_75x75.997102807_t6e2.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/10847850\/il_170x135.997102807_t6e2.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/10847850\/il_570xN.997102807_t6e2.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/10847850\/il_fullxfull.997102807_t6e2.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":950558634,"hex_code":"CF9E81","red":207,"green":158,"blue":129,"hue":22,"saturation":37,"brightness":81,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1459543009,"listing_id":229558763,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/0\/10847850\/il_75x75.950558634_l529.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/0\/10847850\/il_170x135.950558634_l529.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/0\/10847850\/il_570xN.950558634_l529.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/0\/10847850\/il_fullxfull.950558634_l529.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":997102815,"hex_code":"7F7565","red":127,"green":117,"blue":101,"hue":37,"saturation":20,"brightness":49,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1459543009,"listing_id":229558763,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/108\/0\/10847850\/il_75x75.997102815_inqe.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/108\/0\/10847850\/il_170x135.997102815_inqe.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/108\/0\/10847850\/il_570xN.997102815_inqe.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/108\/0\/10847850\/il_fullxfull.997102815_inqe.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":950558624,"hex_code":"625D56","red":98,"green":93,"blue":86,"hue":35,"saturation":12,"brightness":38,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1459543009,"listing_id":229558763,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/133\/0\/10847850\/il_75x75.950558624_ky8j.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/133\/0\/10847850\/il_170x135.950558624_ky8j.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/133\/0\/10847850\/il_570xN.950558624_ky8j.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/133\/0\/10847850\/il_fullxfull.950558624_ky8j.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":950558636,"hex_code":"928674","red":146,"green":134,"blue":116,"hue":36,"saturation":20,"brightness":57,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1459543009,"listing_id":229558763,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/139\/0\/10847850\/il_75x75.950558636_8cja.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/139\/0\/10847850\/il_170x135.950558636_8cja.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/139\/0\/10847850\/il_570xN.950558636_8cja.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/139\/0\/10847850\/il_fullxfull.950558636_8cja.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":10847850,"shop_name":"SmilingAlligator","user_id":63161006,"creation_tsz":1426499275,"title":"Handmade pottery.

However, I want to ensure that all customers are completely satisfied with their purchases, so if there is a problem please do not hesitate to contact me before leaving any negative feedback. I will be happy to work with you to find the best solution possible for the both of us. \r\n\r\nI am not responsible for any packages lost or delayed due to shipping.
